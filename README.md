personal research in mapping complexifying fitness landscapes (loss functions of increasing dimension) for generalization and exploration using the NEAT genetic algorithm by K.Stanley


***Current Status:*** Writting the neat algorithm.



**Goals and thoughts:**
  I hope to find an interesting method for transfer learning from seemingly unrelated domains and with multiple fitness functions relying heavily on concepts of modularity and abstraction in a reinforcement learning setting. Several other research projects will continue from insights gained here. This project is meant to be educational/exploratory and not necessarily efficient. I believe sample efficiency in ANN learning will come from generalization in the form of abstract prior knowledge and pattern recognition across diverse fitness landscapes.
